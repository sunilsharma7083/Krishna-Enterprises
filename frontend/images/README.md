# Hero Image Setup

## How to Add Your Trophy Image

1. Save your trophy image (the one you showed me with the golden trophies) to this folder
2. Rename it to: **hero-trophies.jpg**
3. The image will automatically appear on the home page hero section

### Image Location:
```
/Users/sunilkumarsharma/Desktop/Krishana_Expresis/frontend/images/hero-trophies.jpg
```

### Steps:
1. Open the image you want to use
2. Save/copy it to this `images` folder
3. Make sure the filename is exactly: `hero-trophies.jpg`
4. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000

The hero section will automatically display your trophy image!

If the image doesn't load, it will fallback to a placeholder trophy image from Unsplash.
